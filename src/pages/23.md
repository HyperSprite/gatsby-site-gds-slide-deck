## Add some images to your Images folder


These can be png, jpg and video.


> The paths come from the gds-config file, not the Google Drive folders. In this example, `images` will be in a subdirectory of `pages`, so use **./images/** before the file name in your markdown.


Image example
```md
![My cool image](./images/my-cool-image.jpg)


```
